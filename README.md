# Top 30 Test Wicket-Takers in Cricket

## Overview

This project aims to rank the top 30 players in terms of Test wickets in cricket. Test cricket is the longest format of the sport and is considered the highest standard of the game. Wickets are a significant measure of a bowler's performance, and this ranking provides insights into the most successful bowlers in Test matches.

## Data Source

The data used for this analysis was obtained from [ESPN Cricinfo](https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/most-wickets-in-career-93276), a reputable source for cricket statistics and records. The dataset includes information about the number of wickets taken by each player in Test matches.

## Visualization

The main visualization in this project is a bar plot that ranks the top 30 test wicket-takers in cricket. Each bar represents a player, and the length of the bar corresponds to the number of wickets taken by that player. The bars are arranged in descending order, making it easy to identify the leading players.

## Design Choices

- **Bar Plot**: A bar plot was chosen for its ability to facilitate quick visual comparison of wicket counts for each player.
- **Ranking Order**: The bars are arranged in a specific order to reflect the ranking of players, providing a clear visual hierarchy.
- **Patterns and Trends**: The plot helps identify patterns and trends in the data, such as clusters of players with similar wicket counts.
- **Visual Appeal**: Graphical representation enhances the visual appeal of the data and makes it more engaging for the audience.
- **Accessibility**: The visualization makes the data more accessible to a broader audience, allowing easy interpretation of trends and comparisons.
